# CVD-Final-Project-

In this project, we will analyze [Cardiovascular Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) to find which variables are related to the disease. Then we will use different machine learning models to predict whether the patient has  cardiovascular disease or not. <br>The dataset contains information about patients doing cardiovascular disease examination.<br><br>
**Data features:**
   - Age | Objective Feature | age | int (days)<br>
